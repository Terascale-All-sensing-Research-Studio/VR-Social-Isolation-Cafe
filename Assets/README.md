# Assets

Our study consisted of four treatments: 
1.  No wait for maitre d with No wait for food (coded as 00): In this treatment, the participant engages in dialogue with a virtual maitre d. The folder [00_03_Audio_Files](https://github.com/Terascale-All-sensing-Research-Studio/VR-Social-Isolation-Cafe/blob/main/Assets/00_03_Audio_Files) contains all the audio assets in MP3 format for the 00 treatment.
2.	No wait for maitre d with 3-minute wait for food (coded as 03): In this treatment, the participant engages in dialogue with a virtual maitre d. The folder [00_03_Audio_Files](https://github.com/Terascale-All-sensing-Research-Studio/VR-Social-Isolation-Cafe/blob/main/Assets/00_03_Audio_Files) contains all the audio assets in MP3 format for the 03 treatment.
3.  3-minute wait for maitre d with No wait for food (coded as 30): In this treatment, the participant engages in dialogue with a virtual maitre d, after they are informed to wait. The folder [30_33_Audio_Files](https://github.com/Terascale-All-sensing-Research-Studio/VR-Social-Isolation-Cafe/blob/main/Assets/30_33_Audio_Files) contains all the audio assets in MP3 format for the 30 treatment.
4.  3-minute wait for maitre d with 3-minute wait for food (coded as 33): In this treatment, the participant engages in dialogue with a virtual maitre d, after they are informed to wait. The folder [30_33_Audio_Files](https://github.com/Terascale-All-sensing-Research-Studio/VR-Social-Isolation-Cafe/blob/main/Assets/30_33_Audio_Files) contains all the audio assets in MP3 format for the 33 treatment.

We provide the differences in the audio assets used in each treatment below. **Present** indicates that the audio asset is used in the treatment and **Absent** indicates that the audio asset is not used in the treatment. 

| Audio Asset Name | 00 | 03 | 30 | 33 |
| ----------------------------| ----------------- | --------------------- |--------------------- |--------------------- |
| WithYouShortly.mp3 | Absent | Absent | Present | Present |
| Welcome.mp3 | Present | Present | Present | Present |
| WelcomeLoop.mp3 | Present | Present | Present | Present |
| OkRightThisWay.mp3 | Present | Present | Present | Present |

| Sorry.mp3 | Present | Present | Present | Present |
| FemaleBackgroundConvo.mp3 | Present | Present | Present | Present |
| TrimmedCafeAmbientNoise.mp3 | Present | Present | Present | Present |

We provide the timing of when each audio asset is used in each treatment. We provide the time as Minute:Second format. **Absent** indicates that the audio asset is not used in the treatment. **(variable)** indicates that the event can occur at different time instances depending on when the participant approaches the maitre d NPC, what dialogue options they choose, or if they choose to approach a female customer NPC. **N/A** indicates that an audio asset is not used as it represents a specific event such as the start of the simulation or end of the simulation.

By the way, how is your deal at the office going, hopefully you can close by next month. I am so hungry I can't wait for the wait staff." in a loop | FemaleBackgroundConvo.mp3 | FemaleBackgroundConvo.mp3 |
